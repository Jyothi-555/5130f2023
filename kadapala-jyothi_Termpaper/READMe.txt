A Comparison of Web Caching Techniques and Algorithms for Efficient and Improved Caching

As the internet is reaching a global community, the World Wide Web is evolving into a worldwide data distribution network. There has been an increase in user latency, bandwidth utilization and server loads because of the increased number of World Wide Web users. Web caching is a technology for overcoming such performance by storing copies of popular web objects closer to users instead of deliberately accessing them from origin servers. In this Term Paper a comparison and review of few caching architectures will be made. Some of the architectures that will be studied are proxy caching, push caching and active caching, etc.  

In addition, it has been frequently noted that thousands of users receive the same data sent over the same network channels. In this Term paper caching algorithms that make the best use of the limited cache capacity will be described.
